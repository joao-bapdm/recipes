\section*{Building}

The easiest way to build the document is using the latexmk command. In case
the \texttt{minted} package is used (as in this document), the syntax is as
follows: \mint{bash}|latexmk -shell-escape -pdf main.tex|
otherwise the \texttt{shell-escape} option can be dropped. This command will
call \texttt{latex}, \texttt{bib}, and whatever else is necessary as many
times as needed. Clean up can be performed calling a script such as
\texttt{cleanup\_tex.sh}:
\inputminted[bgcolor=lightgray]{bash}{cleanup_tex.sh}
